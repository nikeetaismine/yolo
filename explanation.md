**Frontend Image Dockerfile**: 
    
    Here's a breakdown of its structure and purpose:

1. **Stage 1: Build Stage**  
   The first stage uses the `node:14-slim` image as the base. This is an official Node.js image that is optimized for smaller size while still including the necessary tools to build and run Node.js applications.  
   - The `WORKDIR /usr/src/app` command sets the working directory inside the container to `/usr/src/app`, where all subsequent commands will be executed.  
   - The `COPY package*.json ./` command copies the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files from the host machine to the container. These files are essential for installing the application's dependencies.  
   - The `RUN npm install` command installs the dependencies listed in `package.json`. This ensures that the application has all the required libraries to function.  
   - The `COPY . .` command copies the rest of the application code from the host machine to the container. This includes the source code, configuration files, and any other necessary assets.

2. **Stage 2: Runtime Stage**  
   The second stage uses the `alpine:3.16.7` image as the base. Alpine Linux is a minimal, lightweight image that helps reduce the overall size of the final Docker image.  
   - The `WORKDIR /app` command sets the working directory for this stage to `/app`.  
   - The `RUN apk update && apk add npm` command updates the Alpine package manager and installs `npm`, which is required to run the Node.js application.  
   - The `COPY --from=build /usr/src/app /app` command copies the built application from the first stage (`/usr/src/app`) into the second stage's working directory (`/app`). This ensures that only the built application and its dependencies are included in the final image, excluding unnecessary build tools.  

3. **Final Configuration**  
   - The `EXPOSE 3000` command declares that the application will listen on port 3000. This is a documentation step for the container runtime and does not actually publish the port.  
   - The `CMD ["npm", "start"]` command specifies the default command to run when the container starts. It uses `npm start` to launch the application, which typically runs the `start` script defined in the `package.json` file.


**Backend Image Dockerfile**

 Here's a detailed explanation of its structure:

1. **Stage 1: Build Stage**

    - The `FROM node:14-slim AS build` line specifies the base image for the first stage, which is also optimized for smaller size while still including the necessary tools to build and run Node.js applications. The AS build syntax names this stage "build" for later reference.
    - The `WORKDIR /usr/src/app` command sets the working directory inside the container to /usr/src/app. All subsequent commands in this stage will be executed relative to this directory.
    - The `COPY package*.json ./` command copies the package.json and package-lock.json files from the host machine to the container. These files are essential for installing the application's dependencies.
    - The `RUN npm install` command installs the dependencies listed in package.json. This ensures that the application has all the required libraries to function.
    - The `COPY . .` command copies the rest of the application code from the host machine to the container. This includes the source code, configuration files, and other necessary assets.

2. **Stage 2: Runtime Stage**

    - The `FROM alpine:3.16.7` line specifies the base image for the second stage. Alpine Linux is a minimal, lightweight image that helps reduce the size of the final Docker image.
    - The WORKDIR /app command sets the working directory for this stage to /app.
    - The `RUN apk update && apk add --update nodejs` command updates the Alpine package manager and installs Node.js. This ensures that the runtime environment has the necessary tools to execute the application.
    - The `COPY --from=build /usr/src/app /app` command copies the built application from the first stage (/usr/src/app) into the second stage's working directory (/app). This step ensures that only the built application and its dependencies are included in the final image, excluding unnecessary build tools and files.

3. **Final Configuration**

    - The `EXPOSE 5000` command declares that the application will listen on port 5000. This is a documentation step for the container runtime and does not actually publish the port. The port is published in the docker-compose.yaml file in the root directory.
    - The `CMD ["node", "server.js"]` command specifies the default command to run when the container starts. It uses Node.js to execute the server.js file, which is typically the entry point of the application.

This multi-stage build approach is efficient because it separates the build environment (with all the tools and dependencies needed to compile the application) from the runtime environment (which only includes the minimal dependencies needed to run the application). This results in a smaller, more secure, and production-ready Docker image.

**Docker-Compose File**
This docker-compose.yaml file orchestrates three services: a frontend, a backend, and a MongoDB database. Additionally, it configures custom networks and a persistent volume for the database. 
Here's a detailed explanation:

 1. **Version Declaration**
The `version: "3.8"` line specifies the Docker Compose file format version. Version 3.8 supports modern Docker features and is widely used for production-ready applications.

 2. **Services**
The `services` section defines the containers that make up the application.

 a. **Frontend Service (`brian-yolo-client`)**
- **Purpose**: Builds and runs the React frontend as a microservice.
- **Key Configurations**:
  - `container_name`: Names the container `brian-yolo-client` for easier identification.
  - `image`: Specifies the Docker image `brianbwire/brian-yolo-client:v1.0.1`.
  - `build`: Points to the client directory, which contains the Dockerfile for building the frontend image.
  - `ports`: Maps port `3000` on the host to port `3000` in the container, making the frontend accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
  - `depends_on`: Ensures the frontend starts only after the backend service (`brian-yolo-backend`) is running.
  - `networks`: Connects the frontend to the `yolo-net` network for communication with other services.

b. **Backend Service (`brian-yolo-backend`)**
- **Purpose**: Builds and runs the Node.js backend as a microservice.
- **Key Configurations**:
  - `container_name`: Names the container `brian-yolo-backend`.
  - `image`: Specifies the Docker image `brianbwire/brian-yolo-backend:v1.0.1`.
  - `build`: Points to the backend directory, which contains the Dockerfile for building the backend image.
  - `ports`: Maps port `5000` on the host to port `5000` in the container, making the backend accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.
  - `restart`: Configures the container to always restart if it stops unexpectedly. This line is commented out for dev testing purposes.
  - `depends_on`: Ensures the backend starts only after the MongoDB service (`yolo-ip-mongo`) is running.
  - `networks`: Connects the backend to the `yolo-net` network.

c. **Database Service (`yolo-ip-mongo`)**
- **Purpose**: Runs a MongoDB database as a microservice.
- **Key Configurations**:
  - `image`: Uses the latest `mongo` image to create the database container. It is the smallest mongo image at the moment on docker hub.
  - `container_name`: Names the container `yolo-mongo`.
  - `ports`: Maps port `27017` on the host to port `27017` in the container, making the database accessible locally.
  - `volumes`: Mounts a persistent volume (`yolo-mongo-data`) to `/data/db` in the container, ensuring that database data persists across container restarts.
  - `networks`: Connects the database to the `yolo-net` network.

 3. **Networks**
The `networks` section defines a custom bridge network named `yolo-net`:
- **`driver`**: Specifies the `bridge` driver, which is the default for Docker networks.
- **`attachable`**: Allows containers to dynamically connect to the network.
- **`ipam`**: Configures IP address management for the network, specifying a subnet (`172.20.0.0/24`) and an IP range.

This network ensures that all services can communicate with each other using container names as hostnames.

 4. **Volumes**
The `volumes` section defines a persistent volume named `yolo-mongo-data`:
- **Purpose**: Ensures that MongoDB data is not lost when the container is stopped or removed.
- **Driver**: Uses the `local` driver to store data on the host machine.

 **Summary**
This docker-compose.yaml file provides a complete setup for running a React/Node.js application with a MongoDB database. It uses Docker Compose to simplify the orchestration of services, ensuring seamless communication between containers and persistent storage for the database.
